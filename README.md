# raml2md

A frontend play microservice that allows you to enter RAML into a text area, 
for it then to be converted into markdown which can be copied or previewed as 
HTML using the [GitHub Markdown API](https://developer.github.com/v3/markdown/).

Provides similar functionality to [sbt-raml2md](https://github.com/peter-hazell/sbt-raml2md), but through a web frontend.
